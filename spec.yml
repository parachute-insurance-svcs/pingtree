  title: PolicyFuel PingTree Specification
  version: 'v1.0'
  description: >
    ## Overview

    This spec implements a two-phase auction system commonly known as "ping
    tree" or "ping post". The purpose of the system is to enable sellers of
    sales leads to solicit bids then fulfill them to winners. The two phases are:

    ### Ping phase

    The seller sends a request to solicit bids from potential buyers. The
    request contains a partial lead without PII. A successful response contains
    zero or more bids from potential buyers, which may be fulfilled later in the
    'post' phase.

    ### Post phase

    The seller declares one or more winners of the auction and sends a request
    to fulfill the complete lead (with PII). Each bidder has a final
    opporitunity to accept the lead and purchase it, or reject the lead. The
    outcomes are indicated in the response.
    
    ## Servers
    
    Sellers may send leads to either of the servers below depending on the
    desired destination. All leads must be sent over secure https connections.
    
    **test.policyfuel.com** is used for development and testing (see below).
    
    **live.policyfuel.com** is used for live production leads.

    ## Test Simulation

    The `test` server is a fully simulated environment which you should use to
    develop your integration with this API. By using known request payload values,
    you can trigger many of the outcomes detailed below, successful or otherwise.

    By default, all valid pings send to the test server will result in a bid.
    The simulated `lead_id` and `bids` may be passed to the 'post' endpoint to
    further simulate a successful 'post' outcome.

    In case you would like to test other scenarios such as rejections or common
    errors, you may provide one of the following values in the
    `#/lead/contact/postal_code` node:

      * `00001` - No bids will be returned on the 'ping'
      * `00002` - Winners will reject the lead on 'post'
      * otherwise - The lead will be accepted on 'ping' and 'post'
    
    ## Technical Support
    
    We are happy to work with your team to overcome any hurdles you may come across
    while integrating. Please provide a detailed summary of the issue encountered as
    well as one or more `transaction_id` values you have collected. Send this to
    integrations@policyfuel.com and we will respond as quickly as possible.

      summary: PING - Solicit bids from potential buyers
      description: >
        The seller sends a request to solicit bids from potential
        buyers. The request contains a partial lead excluding PII. A successful
        response may contain zero or more bids from potential buyers, which the
        seller can choose to fulfill in the 'post' phase.

      summary: POST - Fulfill a complete lead to auction winners
      description: >
        The seller declares one or more winners of the auction by sending a
        request fulfilling the complete lead (with PII). A successful response
        indicates the outcome of each bid, whether the bidder accepted the lead
        (a billable event) or rejected it.

        The request payload consists of:
          * All the same data included in the prior 'ping' phase
          * Additional PII fields in the `contact` and `drivers` objects that
            "complete" the lead
          * The `lead_id` from the prior 'ping'
          * An array of `bids` array in the root object, containing a subset of
            one or more bid(s) from the prior 'ping', in their entirety.

        You are permitted to utilize this endpoint once for each `lead_id`. If
        you would like to offer again a previously offered lead, it must start
        again in the 'ping' phase.
